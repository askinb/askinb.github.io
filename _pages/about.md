I am a second year PhD candidate in the in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Gauri Joshi](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/) and [Dr. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). My research interest broadly lies in distributed optimization, machine learning, and federated learning.

I graduated as the valedictorian from my undergraduate studies in the [Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Tolga Cukur](https://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/) on the deep learning applications of medical imaging.

Here is a link to my [CV](/files/BarisAskinCV.pdf).
